One potential project idea for practicing object-oriented programming in C++ related to video or image could be to create a simple image processing tool.

Here's one possible approach:

1. Define a Pixel class to represent an individual pixel in an image. This class should have properties for red, green, and blue values, as well as any other properties you might want to include (e.g. alpha transparency).

2. Define an Image class to represent an entire image. This class should have properties for width and height, as well as a two-dimensional array of Pixel objects to represent the actual image data.

3. Add methods to the Image class for loading and saving images from disk in a supported file format (e.g. PNG, JPEG, BMP, etc.).

4. Add methods to the Image class for performing various image processing operations, such as adjusting brightness, contrast, or color balance, applying filters like blurs or edge detection, or resizing the image.

5. Finally, write a simple command-line interface that allows the user to load an image, perform one or more operations on it, and save the resulting image to disk.

This project should allow you to practice many of the core concepts of object-oriented programming in C++, including class definitions, method implementations, and the use of libraries for file input/output and image processing. Additionally, it should give you an opportunity to experiment with a range of image processing techniques and learn more about how they work.
